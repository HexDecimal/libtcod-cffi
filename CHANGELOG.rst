===========

5.0.0 - 2017-07-19
------------------
Changed
 - This project was merged back into python-tdl

4.0.0 - 2017-06-29
------------------
Added
 - Console instances can now be pickled.
Changed
 - `get_cffi_callback` renamed to `get_tcod_path_ffi` and must now return width
   and height values.  All returned values will be kept alive by the caller.
Fixed
 - `Image.get_pixel` now returns a tuple instead of a CData instance.
 - SDL is now initialized lazily.  It should be easier to import BearLibTerminal
   along side this library.

3.0.0 - 2017-06-24
------------------
Added
 - PyPy v5.7/v5.8 wheels added to PyPi.
 - Pickle support for tcod.path classes.
 - Added wrapper classes `EdgeCostCallback` and `NodeCostArray` to `tcod.path`
Changed
 - `AStar` and `Dijkstra` no longer take the `width` or `height` parameters.
   You now set these parameters via `EdgeCostCallback`.
Fixed
 - Resolved an issue where pip install would clobber NumPyPy.
Removed
 - Removed broken tdl-style int/color conversions from Color.

2.5.0 - 2017-05-28
------------------
Changed
 - Pickle-able objects will have any subclasses pickled correctly now.
   The new objects can not be unpickled on older versions of libtcod-cffi.
 - Updated cdata attribute names in Map, Console, and Random.

------------------
Fixed
 * Fixed `Console.print_frame` not printing anything.
 * Fixed Noise.sample_ogrid alignment issue.
 * MacOS builds should work even if the system installed SDL2 library is old.

2.2.0 - 2017-02-18
------------------
Added
 * You can now sample very large noise arrays using the `Noise.sample_mgrid`
   and `Noise.sample_ogrid` methods.
 * `Noise` class now supports `pickle` and `copy` modules.

2.1.0 - 2017-02-16
------------------
Added
 * The root `Console` instance can now be used as a context manager.  Closing
   the graphical window when the context exits.
 * Ported libtcod functions: `sys_clipboard_get` and `sys_clipboard_set`.

2.0.0 - 2017-02-11
------------------
Added
 * `Random` instances can be copied and pickled.
 * `Map` instances can be copied and pickled.
 * The `Map` class now has the `transparent`, `walkable`, and `fov` attribues,
   you can assign to these as if they were numpy arrays.
 * Pathfinders in `tcod.path` can be given a numpy array as a cost map.
Changed
 * Color instances can now be compared with any standard sequence.
Deprecated
 * You might see a public `cdata` attribute on some classes, this attribute
   will be renamed at anytime.
Removed
 * `Console.print_str` is now `Console.print_`
 * Some Console methods have been merged together.
 * All litcod-cffi classes have been moved to their own submodules.
 * Random methods renamed to be more like Python's standard `random` module.
 * Noise class had multiple methods replaced by an `implementation` attribute.
 * libtcod-cffi classes and subpackages are not included in the `tcod`
   namespace by default.
 * Many redundant methods were removed from the Random class.
 * Map methods `set_properies`, `clear`, `is_in_fov`, `is_walkable`, and
   `is_transparent` were remvoed.
 * Pathfinding classmethod constructors are gone already.  Not it's just one
   constructor which accepts multiple kinds of maps.
Fixed
 * Python 2 now uses the `latin-1` codec when automatically coverting to
   Unicode.

2.0a4 - 2017-01-09
------------------
Added
 * Console instances now have the fg,bg,ch attributes.
   These attributes are numpy arrays with direct access to libtcod console
   memory.
Changed
 * Console default variables are now accessed using properties instead of
   method calls.  Same with width and height.
 * Path-finding classes new use special classmethod constructors instead of
   tradional class instancing.
Removed
 * Color to string conversion reverted to its original repr behaviour.
 * Console.get_char* methods removed in favor of the fg,bg,ch attributes.
 * Console.fill removed.  This code was redundant with the new additions.
 * Console.get_default_*/set_default_* methods removed.
 * Console.get_width/height removed.
Fixed
 * Dijkstra.get_path fixed.

2.0a3 - 2017-01-02
------------------
* The numpy module is now required as a dependency.
* The SDL.h and libtcod_int.h headers are now included in the cffi back-end.
* Added the AStar and Dijkstra classes with simplified behaviour.
* Added the BSP class which better represents bsp data attributes.
* Added the Image class with methods mimicking libtcodpy behaviour.
* Added the Map class with methods mimicking libtcodpy behaviour.
* Added the Noise class.
  This class behaves similar to the tdl Noise class.
* Added the Random class.
  This class provides a large variety of methods instead of being state based
  like in libtcodpy.
* Color objects can new be converted into a 3 byte string used in libtcod
  color control operations.
* heightmap functions can now accept carefully formatted numpy arrays.
* Removed the keyboard repeat functions:
  console_set_keyboard_repeat and console_disable_keyboard_repeat.

2.0a2 - 2016-10-30
------------------
* FrozenColor class removed.
* Color class now uses a properly set up __repr__ method.
* Functions which take the fmt parameter will now escape the '%' symbol before
  sending the string to a C printf call.
* Now using Google-Style docstrings.
* Console class has most of its relevant methods.
* Added the Console.fill function which needs only 3 numpy arrays instead of
  the usual 7 to cover all Console data.

2.0a1 - 2016-10-16
------------------
* The userData parameter was added back.
  Functions which use it are marked depreciated.
* Python exceptions will now propagate out of libtcod callbacks.
* Some libtcod object oriented functions now have Python class methods
  associated with them (only BSP for now, more will be added later.)
* Regression tests were added.
  Focusing on backwards compatibilty with libtcodpy.
  Several neglected functions were fixed during this.
* All libtcod allocations are handled by the Python garbage collector.
  You'll no longer have to call the delete functions on each object.
* Now generates documentation for Read the Docs.
  You can find the latest documentation for libtcod-cffi
  `here <https://libtcod-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

----------------

------------------
* better Color performance
* parser now works when using a custom listener class
